        DescriptionText.text = "CocoaPods is a dependency management tool for objective-C projects similar to what Maven's for Java projects, which is written in Ruby and is made of several Ruby Gems. The idea is that once you add the third party libraries to your project you'll no longer need to check if there's any newer versions. CocoaPods will handle that for you. It also makes reversing back to a certain version of the library super easy."
